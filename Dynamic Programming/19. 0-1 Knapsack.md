## Given n items, each with a specific weight and value, and a knapsack with a capacity of W, the task is to put the items in the knapsack such that the sum of weights of the items <= W and the sum of values associated with them is maximized. 
Note: You can either place an item entirely in the bag or leave it out entirely. Also, each item is available in single quantity.

```
Input: W = 4, val[] = [1, 2, 3], wt[] = [4, 5, 1] 
Output: 3
Explanation: Choose the last item, which weighs 1 unit and has a value of 3.
```

```java
class Solution {
    static int knapsack(int W, int val[], int wt[]) {
        // Number of items
        int n = val.length;

        // Create a 2D dp array where dp[i][j] represents the maximum value we can obtain
        // using first (i+1) items with capacity j
        int dp[][] = new int[n][W + 1];

        // Initialize the dp array with -1 indicating that those states are not computed yet
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= W; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = -1;
            }
        }

        // Start recursive function from the last index
        return fun(n - 1, W, val, wt, dp);
    }

    public static int fun(int ind, int W, int val[], int wt[], int dp[][]) {
        // Base case: if we're at the first item (index 0)
        if (ind == 0) {
            // If weight of first item is less than or equal to remaining capacity, include it
            if (wt[ind] <= W) {
                return val[ind];
            }
            // Else cannot include it
            return 0;
        }

        // If this state has already been computed, return it
        if (dp[ind][W] != -1) {
            return dp[ind][W];
        }

        // Option 1: Do not take the current item
        int notTake = 0 + fun(ind - 1, W, val, wt, dp);

        // Option 2: Take the current item (if it fits)
        int take = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        if (wt[ind] <= W) {
            take = val[ind] + fun(ind - 1, W - wt[ind], val, wt, dp);
        }

        // Store the result in dp array and return the max of take and notTake
        return dp[ind][W] = Math.max(take, notTake);
    }
}

// Time Complexity: O(N * W), where N is the number of items and W is the maximum capacity.
// Space Complexity: O(N * W) for memoization table (DP array).
