## You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int n = coins.length;

        // Create a 2D dp array where dp[i][j] represents the minimum coins required
        // to make amount j using the first (i+1) coins
        int dp[][] = new int[n][amount + 1];

        // Initialize the dp array with -1 (indicating uncomputed states)
        for (int row[] : dp) {
            Arrays.fill(row, -1);
        }

        // Call the recursive function starting from the last coin index
        int result = fun(n - 1, amount, coins, dp);

        // If result is greater than a high value (unreachable), return -1
        return result > (int) 1e4 ? -1 : result;
    }

    public int fun(int ind, int amount, int coins[], int dp[][]) {
        // Base case: when we're only allowed to use the first coin type
        if (ind == 0) {
            // If the amount is divisible by coins[0], we can make up the amount
            if (amount % coins[ind] == 0) {
                return amount / coins[ind];
            }
            // Otherwise, it's not possible to form the amount
            return (int) 1e9;  // a large number to simulate infinity
        }

        // Return the memoized result if already computed
        if (dp[ind][amount] != -1) {
            return dp[ind][amount];
        }

        // Option 1: Do not take the current coin
        int notTake = 0 + fun(ind - 1, amount, coins, dp);

        // Option 2: Take the current coin (if it's less than or equal to amount)
        int take = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        if (coins[ind] <= amount) {
            take = 1 + fun(ind, amount - coins[ind], coins, dp);
        }

        // Memoize and return the minimum of taking or not taking the coin
        return dp[ind][amount] = Math.min(take, notTake);
    }
}

// Time Complexity: O(N * amount), where N is the number of coins.
// Space Complexity: O(N * amount) for the DP table.
