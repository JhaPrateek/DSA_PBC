## Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of steps required to make word1 and word2 the same. In one step, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

Example 1:
Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".

### Intutuion
The intuition behind this approach is based on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS). To make two strings identical with the minimum number of deletions, we need to preserve their common characters as much as possible. The LCS represents the longest sequence that both strings share in the same order. If we remove all other characters except for the LCS, both strings will become identical.
Thus, the minimum deletions required to make word1 and word2 the same is:
(Length of word1+Length of word2)−2×LCS
This formula works because we count the total number of characters in both strings and subtract twice the LCS length (once for each string) since those characters are already common and should be retained. The recursive function efficiently finds LCS using memoization to optimize redundant computations. 

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int m = word1.length();  // Length of first string
        int n = word2.length();  // Length of second string
        
        int dp[][] = new int[m][n];  // Memoization table to store LCS results
        for (int row[] : dp) {
            Arrays.fill(row, -1);  // Initialize DP table with -1 (uncomputed state)
        }

        // Formula: (Total length of both strings) - (2 * LCS length)
        return (m + n) - 2 * (fun(m - 1, n - 1, word1, word2, dp));
    }

    public int fun(int i, int j, String word1, String word2, int dp[][]) {
        // Base case: If either string is exhausted, LCS is 0
        if (i < 0 || j < 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        // If the subproblem has been solved already, return stored result
        if (dp[i][j] != -1) {
            return dp[i][j];
        }

        // If characters match, add 1 to LCS and move diagonally in both strings
        if (word1.charAt(i) == word2.charAt(j)) {
            return dp[i][j] = 1 + fun(i - 1, j - 1, word1, word2, dp);
        }

        // If characters don't match, take max of:
        // 1. Moving left in word1 (reduce i)
        // 2. Moving up in word2 (reduce j)
        return dp[i][j] = Math.max(fun(i - 1, j, word1, word2, dp), fun(i, j - 1, word1, word2, dp));
    }
}

```
