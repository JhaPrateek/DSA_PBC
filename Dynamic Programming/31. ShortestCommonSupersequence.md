## Given two strings str1 and str2, return the shortest string that has both str1 and str2 as subsequences. If there are multiple valid strings, return any of them. A string s is a subsequence of string t if deleting some number of characters from t (possibly 0) results in the string s.

Example 1:
Input: str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab"
Output: "cabac"
Explanation: 
str1 = "abac" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the first "c".
str2 = "cab" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the last "ac".
The answer provided is the shortest such string that satisfies these properties.

### Intution
The intuition behind this approach is based on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) concept. The Shortest Common Supersequence (SCS) is the shortest string that contains both str1 and str2 as subsequences. Instead of blindly merging both strings, we want to retain their common characters while minimizing repetitions.
To achieve this, we first compute the LCS, which helps us identify the common part of both strings. Using this information, we construct the SCS by iterating through both strings and including:
Common characters (from LCS) only once.
Extra characters from either string wherever necessary to maintain order.
This ensures that we preserve the order of both strings while keeping the length minimal. Finally, since we build the sequence in reverse, we return its reversed form. 

```java
class Solution {
    public String shortestCommonSupersequence(String str1, String str2) {
        int m = str1.length();
        int n = str2.length();
        int dp[][] = new int[m + 1][n + 1];

        // Step 1: Compute the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) using Dynamic Programming
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                // If characters match, take diagonal value +1
                if (str1.charAt(i - 1) == str2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    // If characters don't match, take max from top or left
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Construct the Shortest Common Supersequence (SCS) from LCS table
        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();
        int i = m, j = n;

        while (i > 0 && j > 0) {
            if (str1.charAt(i - 1) == str2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                // If characters match, add to result and move diagonally up-left
                ans.append(str1.charAt(i - 1));
                i--;
                j--;
            } else if (dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]) {
                // If the value above is greater, move up in str1
                ans.append(str1.charAt(i - 1));
                i--;
            } else {
                // If the value on the left is greater, move left in str2
                ans.append(str2.charAt(j - 1));
                j--;
            }
        }

        // Step 3: Add remaining characters (if any) from str1
        while (i > 0) {
            ans.append(str1.charAt(i - 1));
            i--;
        }

        // Step 4: Add remaining characters (if any) from str2
        while (j > 0) {
            ans.append(str2.charAt(j - 1));
            j--;
        }

        // Step 5: Reverse the final string since it was built in reverse order
        return ans.reverse().toString();
    }
}

```
