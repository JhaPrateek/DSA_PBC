### Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number

Given two integers start and goal. Flip the minimum number of bits of start integer to convert it into goal integer.
A bits flip in the number val is to choose any bit in binary representation of val and flipping it from either 0 to 1 or 1 to 0.

Examples:

Input : start = 10 , goal = 7
Output : 3
Explanation : The binary representation of 10 is "1010".
The binary representation of 7 is "111".
If we flip the underlined bits in binary representation of 10 then we will obtain our goal.

Input : start = 3 , goal = 4
Output : 3
Explanation : The binary representation of 3 is "011".
The binary representation of 4 is "100".
So if we flip all the three bits of 3 then we will reach our goal number.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minBitsFlip(int start, int goal) {

        // XOR gives bits that are different between start and goal
        int num = start ^ goal;
        int cnt = 0;

        // Traverse all 32 bits of the integer
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            // Extract last bit (LSB) and add to count if bit is 1
            cnt += (num & 1);
            // Right shift to check next bit
            num = num >> 1;
        }

        return cnt;   // Total number of bits to flip
    }
}
//Time Complexity: O(32) → O(1) constant
//Space Complexity:	O(1)
```

```java
Optimised
public int minBitsFlip(int start, int goal) {
    return Integer.bitCount(start ^ goal);  // Counts 1s directly
}
```
